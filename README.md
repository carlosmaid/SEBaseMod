# SEBaseMod

For fellow modders from modders: Some base classes that make creating a new script mod easier. 
If you have useful classes feel free to add it to the project.
All code found in this repo is meant to be used in other mods.

Documentation can be found in the wiki... Soon:tm:. And in the code... Soon:tm:.

The mod adds a session component, a base class for your files, a helper class for sending your messages (not chat but network), a base class for your messages, a simple logger, that will log your stuff to the game's log and can display the stuff on the dedicated server's console. On top of that there are threadsafe timers and some extensions included in the project. You'll find most of the documentation in the code and the fundamental things in the wiki. Have fun!
